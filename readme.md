Design framnework:

1. The home page is one HTML file so its easy to create new 1 page websites and see which one sells the best from paid advertising.

2. The blog uses ghost on sqlite since we like simple. to install ghost:
npm install ghost-cli@latest -g
cd blogh
ghost install local

3. How to test locally?
python3 -m http.server 8000
and then localhost:8000/index.html
ok
